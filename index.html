    You may well ask: How can I start using HTML5 if older browsers
    dont support it? is misleading. HTML5 is not one big thing; it is a collection of
    individual features. So you cant detect HTML5 support, because that doesnt make <an></an>y
    sense. But you can detect support for individual features, like canvas, video, or geolocation.
    <br><br>
    You may think of HTML as tags and angle brackets. Thats an important part of it, but
    its not the whole story. The HTML5 specification also defines how those angle brackets
    interact with JavaScript, through the Document Object Model (DOM). HTML5 doesnt just define a <"video"> tag; there
    is
    also a corresponding DOM API for video objects in the DOM. You can use this API to detect support for different
    video
    formats, play a video, pause, mute audio, track how much of the video has been downloaded, and everything else you
    need
    to build a rich user experience around the <"video"> tag itself.<br><br>

    Chapter 2 and <a href="#">Appendix A</a> will teach you how to propCopyright MMIX–MMXI Mark Pilgrimerly detect
    support for each new
    HTML5 feature.</p>

    Love it or hate it, you cant deny that HTML 4 is the most successful markup format ever. HTML5
    builds on that success. You dont need to throw away your existing markup. You dont need to
    relearn things you already know. If your web application worked yesterday in HTML 4, it will still
    work today in HTML5. Period.
    <br><br>
    Now, if you want to improve your web applications, you have come to the right place. Here's a concrete
    example: HTML5 supports all the form controls from HTML 4, but it also includes new input controls.
    Some of these are long-overdue additions like sliders and date pickers; others are more subtle. For
    example, the email input type looks just like a text box, but mobile browsers will customize their
    onscreen keyboard to make it easier to type email addresses. Older browsers that dont support the email input type
    will
    treat it as a regular text field, and the form still works with no markup changes or scripting hacks. This means you
    can
    start improving your web forms today, even if some of your visitors are stuck on IE 6.<br> <br>

    “Upgrading” to HTML5 can be as simple as changing your doctype. The doctype should
    already be on the first line of every HTML page. Previous versions of HTML defined a
    lot of doctypes, and choosing the right one could be tricky. In HTML5, there is only one
    doctype:
    <br><br>
    <"!DOCTYPE html"><br><br>

    Upgrading to the HTML5 doctype wwill not break your existing markup, because <a href="#">obsolete
        elements</a> previously defined in HTML 4 will still render in HTML5. But it will allow you
    to use — and validate — new semantic elements like <"article">, <"section">, <"header">, and <"footer">. You will
    learn all
    about these new elements in Chapter3<br> <br>

    Whether you want to draw on a canvas, play video, design better forms, or build web
    applications that work offline, you’ll find that HTML5 is already well-supported. Firefox
    , Safari, Chrome, Opera, and mobile browsers already support canvas (Chapter 4), video
    (Chapter 5), geolocation (Chapter 6), local storage (Chapter 7), and more. Google already
    supports microdata annotations (Chapter 10). Even Microsoft — rarely known for blazing
    the trail of standards support — supports most HTML5 features in Internet Explorer 9.

    Each chapter of this book includes the all-too-familiar browser
    compatibility charts. But more importantly, each chapter includes
    a frank discussion of your options if you need to support older browsers. HTML5 features like
    geolocation (Chapter 6) and video (Chapter 5) were first provided by browser plugins like Gears or
    Flash. Other features, like canvas (Chapter 4), can be emulated entirely in JavaScript. This book will
    teach you how to target the native features of modern browsers, without leaving older browsers behind.

    Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in the early 1990s. He later founded the W3C to act as a steward of web
    standards, which the organization has
    <br>
    <br>
    ne for more than 15 years. Here is what the W3C had to say about the future of
    web standards, in July 2009:<br><br>

    Today the Director announces that when the XHTML 2 Working Group charter expires as scheduled at the end
    of 2009, the charter will not be renewed. By doing so, and by increasing resources in the HTML Working Group,
    W3C hopes to accelerate the progress of HTML5 and clarify W3Cs position regarding the future of HTML.<br><br>
